# Sudoku Solution Validator
 
 This program defines a sudoku puzzle solution and then determines whether 
 the puzzle solution is valid using 27 threads. 9 for each 3x3 subsection, 9
 for the 9 columns, and 9 for the 9 rows. Each thread updates their index in 
 a global array to 1 indicating that the corresponding region in the puzzle
 they were responsible for is valid. The program then waits for all threads
 to complete their execution and checks if all entries in the valid array have been set to 1. If yes, the solution is valid. If not, solution is invalid.
